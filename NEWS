Note: I try to write very descriptive log messages when I commit changes.
Run git log for much more information.

December 24, 2007:
	Finished split of userspace/kernel portion of trustees.  From now
	on, trustees will be developed as a fork of the vanilla kernel.
	This is much simpler to manage updating for newer kernels.

November 7, 2007:
    Added testsuite.  See testsuite/README for more details.  The actual
    tests still need to be written, but the framework is mostly there.

November 7, 2007:
    Redid caching code, see commit message for more details.  Added hash_size
    module parameter for setting size of hash table.

June 10, 2007:
    Bumped for kernel 2.6.21, this is now required for trustees.   In the
    future, multiple stable kernel revisions will be supported.

    trusteesfs was removed in favor of securityfs which is already
    in the kernel.  You should mount -t securityfs none /sys/kernel/security
    upon boot.  In the future, most security modules should be using
    this interface.  It is no longer necessary to unmount this to remove
    the trustees module and it can be mounted prior to loading trustees.
